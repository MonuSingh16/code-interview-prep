    "Given the root node of a binary tree, transform the tree by swapping each nodeâ€™s left and right subtrees, thus creating a mirror image of the original tree. Return the root of the transformed tree.\n",

    "Every subtree needs to be mirrored, so we visit every node once. Because of that, the runtime complexity is O(n) and The space complexity of this solution is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. The complexity will be O(logn) for a balanced tree and O(n) for a degenerate tree."
